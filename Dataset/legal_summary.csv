"ition (Crl.) No. 2989 of 1983.
(Under article 32 of the Constitution) R.L. Panjwani, Manoj Saxena and R.D. Upadhaya for the petitioners.
The Order of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C.J, The question raised in this petition is whether the Government can ask the police not to enter a place of worship, even if criminals are reported to be hiding or harboured therein.
It is impossible and undesirable for any Court to issue a general writ of Mandamus to the effect that whenever a criminal is suspected to have taken shelter in a place of worship, the police must enter that place, regardless of the overall situation of law and order.
Speaking generally, Courts cannot enforce law and order by issuing general directions without reference to specific instances.
The Government has to assess, in the context of the prevailing conditions, the impact of the steps taken to enforce law and order.
And, it is the executive which has to take a policy decision as regards the steps to be taken in a given situation, after 903 taking into account the demands of the prevailing situation.
We do not commend or suggest that the police should be silent spectators to wanton destruction of life but we cannot, as men of some little experience of law and life, commend that the police must enter places of worship forcibly.
While enforcing law and order, the executive cannot be oblivious of the possibility that while solving one problem of law and order, others more acute than the one sought to be solved may arise.
That is always a valid and relevant consideration.
With these observations, we dismiss this petition filed by two public spirited organisations through their courageous convenor and secretary respectively.
M.L.C. Petition dismissed.","HELD: It is the executive which has to take a policy decision as regards the steps to be taken in a given situation, after taking into account the demands of the prevailing situation.

"Civil Appeal No. 2291 of 1980.
Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated the 21st November, 1978 of the Kerala High Court in TRC No. 31 of 1978.
P.K. Pillai for the Appellant.
C. Agarwala for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J.
This appeal is filed against the judgment dated November 21, 1978 of the High Court of Kerala in The Jay Engineering Works Ltd. vs State of Kerala(1).
In Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (Law), Board of Revenue (Taxes), Ernakulam vs M/s. Motor Industries Co., Ernakulam(2), we 362 have held that any claim for deduction in respect of goods returned by the purchasers under Rule 9 (b) (i) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963 should be made in the assessment proceedings relating to the year in which the said goods were sold and not in the assessment proceedings relating to the assessment year in which they were actually returned.
following the above decision we set aside the judgment of the High Court in this case and direct that the assessment order for the year 1972 73 shall be accordingly modified.
As a consequence of this order, the Department is directed to modify the assessment order for the assessment year 1971 72 by allowing deduction under Rule 9 (b) (i) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963 and to make refund of any excess tax paid during that year.
The appeal is accordingly allowed.
No costs.

The Order of the Court was delivered by PATHAK, CJ.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties briefly, we are satisfied that the judgment and order dated 20 December, 1986 of which review is sought, should be recalled and the cases be heard again on the merits.
It appears to us prima facie that in respect of certain items an inconsistency is present in the impugned judgment when regard is had to the law laid down by this Court in Union of India vs Bombay Tyres International Ltd., ; Inasmuch as the cases are being re opened, we refrain from expressing any opinion at this stage on the merits of the points raised in the cases.
Objection was taken by the respondent manufacturers to the Review Petitions on the ground that the finality of the judgment should be maintained and should not be disturbed lightly.
In our opinion, the points raised by the petitioners are of substantial public importance, and therefore call for recon sideration.
Accordingly, we allow the Review Petitions, and recall the judgment and order dated 20 December, 1986 and restore the cases to their original number and direct that they be listed again for fresh consideration.
There is no order as to costs.
N.P. V Petitions allowed.","The petitioners revenue filed petitions for review of the judgment and order dated December 20, 1986 passed by this Court.

980 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by THAKKAR, J.
The widespread belief that dowry deaths are even now treated with some casualness at all levels seems to be well grounded.
The High Court has granted anticipatory bail in such a matter.
We are of the opinion that the High Court should not have exercised its jurisdiction to release the accused on anticipatory bail in disregard of the magni tude and seriousness of the matter.
The matter regarding the unnatural death of the daughter in law at the house of her father in law was still under investigation and the appro priate course to adopt was to allow the concerned Magistrate to deal with the same on the basis of the material before the Court at the point of time of their arrest in case they were arrested.
It was neither prudent nor proper for the High Court to have granted anticipatory bail which order was very likely to occasion prejudice by its very nature and timing.
We therefore consider it essential to sound a seri ous note of caution for future.
The High Court is under no compulsion to exercise its jurisdiction to grant anticipato ry bail in a matter of this nature.
So far as the present matter is concerned, since it has become infructuous, we do not propose to pass any order.
Subject to these observa tions, the appeal is dismissed.
P.S.S. Appeal dismissed.","While the matter regarding the unnatural death of the daughter in law at the house of her father in law was still under investigation the High Court grunted anticipatory bail to the accused in disregard of the magnitude and seriousness of the matter.
Subsequent to the filing of the appeal by special leave by the father of the deceased the investigation had been concluded by the police and challan filed, and the accused were released on bail by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.
Dismissing the appeal as infructuous, the Court, HELD: The High Court was under no compulsion to exercise its jurisdiction to grant anticipatory bail in a matter of this nature.
[980D] The appropriate course to adopt was to allow the con cerned Magistrate to deal with the case on the basis of the material before him at the point of time of accused 's arrest in case they were arrested.

From the Judgment and Order dated the 23rd January, 1984 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Crl.
Appeal No. 45 of 1983.
Harbans Lal and Balmokand Goyal for the Petitioner.
The Order of the Court was delivered by DESAI, J.
We are not inclined to grant special leave, but we make this short speaking order in order to keep the record straight that the dismissal of the special leave petition does not tentamount to affirmance of the order of the learned Judge of the High Court who for reasons utterly untenable interfered with teh 215 sentence imposed by the trial court and reduced it to sentence already undergone which in the facts and circumstances of the case was wholly impermissible.
In Meet Singh vs State of Punjab,(1) this Court pointed out that Sec.
5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act prescribes a minimum sentence and discretion is conferred on the court to give less than the minimum for any special reasons to be recorded in writing.
This Court examined what constitute special reasons for the purpose of Sec.
5(2) and pointed out that the reasons which weighed with the learned Judge in reducing the sentence to the sentence undergone could not be special reasons.
Therefore, in our view, the learned Judge was entirely in error in showing a misplaced sympathy unsustainable in law.
With these observations we reject the special leave petition.
N.V.K. Petition dismissed.","Section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 prescribes a minimum sentence and discretion is conferred on the Court to give less than the minimum for any 'special reasons ' to be recorded in writing.

1731 and 927 of 1978.
From the Judgment and order dated 3 11 76 of the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) in W.P. 116 of 1971 and from the Judgment and order dated 5 8 77 of the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) in Revision Application No. 29/77 respectively.
R. K. Garg, Madan Mohan and V. J. Francis for the Petitioner.
The order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.
For around 50 years, a man and a woman, as the facts in this case unfold, lived as husband and wife.
An adventurist challenge to the factum of marriage between the two, by the petitioner in this special leave petition, has been negatived by the High Court.
A strong presumption arises in favour of wed lock where the partners have lived together for a long spell as husband and wife.
Although the presumption is rebuttable, a heavy burden lies on him who seeks to deprive the relationship of legal origin.
Law leans in favour of legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy.
In this view, the contention of Shri Garg, for the petitioner, that long after the alleged marriage, evidence has not been produced to sustain its ceremonial process by examining the priest or other witnesses, deserves no consideration.
If man and woman who live as husband and wife in society are compelled to prove, half a century later, by eye witness evidence that they were validly married, few will succeed.
The contention deserves to be negatived and we do so without hesitation.
The special leave petitions are dismissed.

This petition is totally bereft of any statement of facts.
It has been drafted and filed in a most casual and careless manner.

Gupta for the Respondents.","% In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 239(2)(E)(a) of the Uttar Pradesh Kshetra Samiti and Zila Parishads Adhiniyam, 1961, various Zila Parishads framed a bye law, providing that right to trade in carcass utilisation in the rural area of the respective Zila Parishads shall be put to public auction.
Such activities comprised of taking of the carcass of dead animals to a specified place, skinning of the carcass, storage of bones and skins, curing and dyeing of such skins and preparation of leather goods.
In a writ petition challenging the validity of the said bye law, a Single Judge of the High Court struck down the latter part of the bye law framed by one of the Zila Parishads, providing for farming out of the privilege of utilisation and disposal of carcass of dead animals, on the ground that it created a monopoly in favour of an individual or group of individuals.
A Division Bench reiterated that view in two writ petitions filed before it, and distinguished the decision of this Court in State of Maharashtra vs Mumbai Upnagar Gramodyog Sangh, ; taking a contrary view on the ground that the restrictions were reason able within the meaning of article 19(6), in the context of the thickly populated metropolitan city.
The correctness of the said decision of the Division Bench was open to question.
Another Division Bench referred the matter to a Full Bench, which expressly repelled the aforesaid view, and held that it was competent for the Zila Parishads to frame such bye laws in exercise of the powers conferred by section 239(2)(E)(a) of the Act.
539 Against the various judgments and orders of the High Court, special leave petitions and appeals by special leave challenging the constitutional validity of the aforesaid bye law, were filed in this Court.
In SLP(C) No. 1900 of 1981, this Court, in order to protect the interests of persons traditionally engaged in the work of skinning, tanning etc., directed the State Government to frame a Model Scheme for carcass utilisation in the Etawa district at the village panchayat level on an experimental basis, and passed certain incidental directions as to the price payable for skins, bones and horns.
As nothing further was done, in partial modification of its earlier orders, this Court directed the Zila Parishad, Etawa to issue licence to any person who applied for the same.
In the meantime, the Government of Uttar Pradesh issued a Circular dated June 7, 1986 stating that in future the licences for disposal of carcass of animals should be granted only to registered industrial cooperative societies formed by the persons engaged in this work.
Disposing of the Special Leave Petitions and civil appeals, ^ HELD: It is plain upon the reading of the Circular dated June 7, 1986 issued by the State Government that the contract system envisaged by the impugned bye law framed by the different Zila Parishads in the State has been virtually abandoned, and the State Government proposes to replace the system of auction by a system of licensing, giving preferential right to cooperative societies consisting of members of the traditional occupation, for the disposal of carcass of dead animals.
[544E F] In view of the subsequent policy decision taken by the State Government, the present controversy no longer survives.
It would be open to different Zila Parishads, in view of the directive of the State Government, to frame the appropriate Bye laws consistent with and for the implementations of the policy declared by the State Government.
The Zila Parishads, while considering the question, shall keep in view the directions issued by this Court on April 15, 1983, and also the order passed introducing the licence system in the Zila Parishad, Etawa on an experimental basis.[544F G] For a meaningful effectuation of the policy decision of the Government, which is taken in the larger interests of a sizeable segment of the weaker sections of the society, it is of utmost importance that the 540 work of formation of cooperative society of the members of the traditional occupation, who lack the will and the ability to organise themselves, should be taken up by the social welfare department of the State Government and every effort should be made to bring the members of the traditional occupation within the fold of these cooperative societies.
The social welfare department shall take effective steps to organise such cooperative societies.
[544H; 545A B] Wherever it is not possible to implement the policy decision and there is likely to be a loss of revenue or other compelling reason, it would be open to the Zila Parishads, as a purely transitory measure and with the prior concurrence of the State Government, to arrange for carcass utilisation by auction if the Bye laws permit such auction.
It is only where, for any compelling reason, the said policy decision cannot be implemented effectively in any area, that the concerned Zila Parishad could, with the prior sanction of the State Government, continue the present contract system subject to such variation as may be necessary till the cooperative societies are formed.

": Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 2088 of 1979.
From the Judgment and Order dated 25 7 1979 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Revision No. 1189/79.
N. Ali Khan and A. D. Mathur for the Petitioner The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.
Counsel for the petitioner states that the sentence imposed upon his client for the offence under section 7 read with section 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act must be reduced because the adulterant, namely, prohibited coal tar dye, is, in his submission, non injurious or an innocent mix.
Therefore, the imprisonment part of the sentence, it was urged, should be eliminated.
It is true that the High Court has observed that the ""colour which was mixed with powdered chillies"" is not mentioned in the Public Analyst 's report to be injurious to human life.
It does not follow that because it is not specifically mentioned to be injurious, it is non injurious.
Absence of evidence is not equal to evidence of absence.
For ought we know, the prohibition under the Act and the Rules has been imposed because it is harmful to human health.
It is true that the High Court has, under a mis conception, reduced the sentence, but we cannot be pressurised further into following the wrong path.
